# How Java works
## Java is a hybrid language
For most programming languages, the code is compiled into a mahine-language program and then can be executed. It only allows the program to be executed in the specific operating system it was designed to run, meaning, you would have to write a
new version of the same code for every operating systems there is.

Java doesn't follow this patttern. Java follows the 'WORA' principle: Write once, run anywhere. With Java, we only have to write the code once, and it can run in any operating system.
This is possible beause of the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). It works like this: The code you write is not compiled into a machine-language, instead it is compiled into a bytecode file, which 
is machine-independent. Once the JVM has the bytecode, it can be executed in any device, may it be Windows, Linux, macOS, mobile, etc.
That's why we call Java a hybrid language.
